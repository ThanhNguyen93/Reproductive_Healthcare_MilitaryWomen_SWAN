 Access To Reproductive Health Care: The Experiences of Military Women Reproductive care for service women and women veterans has historically been a neglected area of attention by military and veteran health care providers. In 2018, SWAN conducted a survey to pinpoint areas of need relative to three categories of reproductive care; access to birth control, infertility services and abortion care. The report, “Access To Reproductive Health Care: The Experiences of Military Women,” provides key findings and recommendations from SWAN’s comprehensive survey.
